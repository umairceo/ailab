Certainly! Below are the CLI commands you can use to configure each device based on the provided addressing table:

### Router (R)

```
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
ip address 172.16.5.1 255.255.0.0
no shutdown
exit
exit
write memory
```

### Switch 1 (S1)

```
enable
configure terminal
interface VLAN 1
ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
exit
write memory
```

### Switch 2 (S2)

```
enable
configure terminal
interface VLAN 1
ip address 172.16.5.2 255.255.0.0
no shutdown
exit
exit
write memory
```

### PC-A, PC-B, PC1, PC2 (assuming Windows)

You can configure the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway using Windows command prompt. Here's how you can do it:

```
netsh interface ipv4 set address name="Local Area Connection" static 172.16.5.3 255.255.0.0 172.16.5.1
netsh interface ipv4 set address name="Local Area Connection" static 172.16.5.4 255.255.0.0 172.16.5.1
netsh interface ipv4 set address name="Local Area Connection" static 192.168.1.3 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
netsh interface ipv4 set address name="Local Area Connection" static 192.168.1.4 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
```

Replace "Local Area Connection" with the name of your network interface if it's different.

### Testing Connectivity

Once configurations are applied, you can test connectivity using the `ping` command:

```
ping <IP address of the destination device>
```

Make sure to test connectivity between devices within the same subnet and across different subnets to verify that the configurations are correct and communication is established as expected.
