Here are the organized commands with instructions for each part of the activity:

**Part 1: Basic Connections**
- Connect all devices together using copper straight through connections as depicted in figure 4.1.

**Part 2: Accessing the CLI and Basic Configuration**
- Access the CLI of S1 switch.
- Perform basic configurations such as setting the clock, assigning a hostname, setting a banner, configuring console and privilege mode passwords, and enabling encryption.

**Part 3 and 4: Implement Basic Addressing on Network Devices**
- Configure the management interface of S1 with an IP address.
```plaintext
S1(config)# interface vlan 1
S1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
S1(config-if)# no shutdown
S1(config-if)# exit
S1(config)# ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
S1(config)# exit
S1# copy running-config startup-config
```
- Configure interfaces on Router R with IP addresses.
```plaintext
R> enable
R # configure terminal
R (config) # interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
R(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
R(config-if)# description connected to ACCOUNTS
R(config-if)# no shutdown
R(config-if)# end
R# copy running-config startup-config
```

**Part 5: Configure DHCPv4 on Router**
```plaintext
R(config)# service dhcp
R(config)# ip dhcp pool ACCOUNTS
R(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
R(dhcp-config)# default-router 192.168.1.1
R(dhcp-config)# dns-server 8.8.8.8
R(dhcp-config)# exit
R(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
R(config)# exit
R# write memory
```

**Part 6: Enable DHCP Services in PCs**
- Enable DHCP on each PC by going to the DESKTOP tab, navigating to IP configuration, and checking on DHCP.

**Part 7: Verify DHCP Services on Router R**
- Check DHCP address leases:
```plaintext
R# show ip dhcp binding
```
- View DHCP pool statistics and message activity:
```plaintext
R# show ip dhcp server statistics
```
- View DHCP pool settings:
```plaintext
R# show ip dhcp pool
```
- View DHCP configuration in the running configuration:
```plaintext
R# show run | section dhcp
```

**Part 8: Verify Network Connectivity by Using PING**
- From each PC, ping the IP addresses for S1 and R, as well as the default gateway.
- Ensure all pings are successful. If not, troubleshoot connectivity issues.

These commands and steps should help you complete each part of the activity.
